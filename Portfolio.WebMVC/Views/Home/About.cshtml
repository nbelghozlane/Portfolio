    Hello! My name is Nadia Belghozlane.<br>
    I am currently a software development student at Eleven Fifty Academy and will be graduating in May 2021.<br>
    Before Eleven Fifty, I attended Purdue University Northwest/Fort Wayne and received my Bachelor of Science degree
    in Communication Sciences and Disorders in December 2016. I planned on becoming a speech-language pathologist, but
    decided it was not the right fit and wanted to pursue a software development career instead.
    I immediately fell in love with coding after starting at Eleven Fifty. In the last six months,
    I’ve gained over 500 hours of coding experience and learning time.<br>
    <br>
    Some of my skills include:<br>
    •	C# <br>
    •	ASP.NET <br>
    •	Web API<br>
    •	Web MVC<br>
    •	Console Applications<br>
    •	HTML & CSS<br>
    •	Bootstrap<br>
    •	Git<br>
