            <h3>Hello! My name is Nadia Belghozlane.</h3>
            I am a recent software development graduate from Eleven Fifty Academy in Indianapolis, IN (May 2021). 
            I have a short, but strong history in coding. Before Eleven Fifty, I attended Purdue University Northwest/Fort Wayne and received my Bachelor of Science degree
            in Communication Sciences and Disorders in December 2016. I planned on becoming a speech-language pathologist, but
            decided it was not the right fit and wanted to pursue a software development career instead. Having more free time during the pandemic
            gave me the final push to start learning this new skill.
            I immediately fell in love with coding after starting at Eleven Fifty. In the last six months,
            I’ve gained over 500 hours of coding experience and learning time. <br />
            <br />
            Some of my skills include: <br /> <br />
            • C#<br />
            • ASP.NET <br />
            • Web API <br />
            • Web MVC <br />
            • Console Applications <br />
            • HTML & CSS <br />
            • Bootstrap <br />
            • Git <br />
